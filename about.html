  <h1>{{ site.name }}</h1>

  <p>I was born in Oak Lawn, Illinois, raised in Scottsdale, Arizona and attended college in New England.
      Relocating to Carlsbad, California in 2011 was a long time dream come true.
      My educational and professional background is in Creative Marketing.
      I have applied my marketing skills from grass roots efforts to corporate environments.
      I consider myself versatile and easily adaptable to the ever changing business landscape.
      In all of my roles I have consistently aimed to gain the most amount of exposure using the most cost effective and creative ways possible for the company I am representing.
      I am looking forward to joining a new company where I have the opportunity to combine all of my past experience to effectively and consistently generate and manage leads for new business. </p>
